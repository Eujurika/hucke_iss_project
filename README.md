## General info

TThis project was created as part of the HfK course (Always under Construction) and contains a dynamic website which was created using the D3.js framework. On the website, the position of the ISS on the globe can be displayed, as well as some additional information about the overflight of the individual countries. The website is first of all intended to invite the user to explore and find out what can be done with the minimalist, scientifically stylistic layout. The user can get more detailed information by clicking on the information button (i).

Small disclaimer: For the development, the SetUp of my father JÃ¼rgen Hucke was partly used by me, so there are a few commits under this name. My father was also sometimes able to help me with difficult problems through pair programming. (After all, four eyes see more than two).
